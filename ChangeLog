cmatrix 2.0 - 05/18/2015
- Updated autoconf/automake support
- Remove -o old-style scrolling mode
- New command-line argument: -f [filename]
  Display text contained within filename in a floating window
  above the matrix background. But wait, there's more!
  You may also pipe command output into cmatrix or use your
  shell's redirection operators to pipe a file's contents into 
  the floating window. For example:

    $ cowsay Wake up, Neo | cmatrix

- Add -w argument which draws a border around the floating text
  window.

cmatrix 1.2a - 03/31/2002
- Eliminated MAXLINES and MAXCOLS variables, now uses malloc()
  to allocate the necessary memory for the lines and cols.  Vars 
  matrix, spaces, length, updates all moved to global variables
  as pointers.  New function var_init().  New malloc wrapper 
  nmalloc (taken from nano).
- Added resize code, mostly taken from nano.  New configure.in checks
  for resizeterm() and wresize().  New signal handler handle_sighup().
- The -f option now forces the linux $TERM type ON instead of OFF, since
  modern Linux systems seem to work fine without it.
- Added config.sub and config.guess
- Added cmatrix.spec.in file, based on nanos.spec.in file by 
  Brett <brett@bad-sports.com>.
cmatrix-1.1b - 04/09/2000
- Added support for consolechars command as well as setfont.  Changes
  affect configure.in and cmatrix.c (main).
- cmatrix.c:
  main():
	- Changed optchr and keypress to ints.  Fixes endless loop
	  condition on Irix.		
  c_die():
	- New function, uses va_args to die with better info on the
	  screen.
- configure.in:
  - Rewrote tests for console and X window font directories.  Moved all
    font searches to end of the file so error messages could be more
    easily seen when running configure.
- Makefile.am:
  - Better information messages for installing X window fonts.

cmatrix-1.1a - 04/03/2000
- New autoconf support.  Probably a few things broken but it's a helluva
  lot better than the previous Makefile stuff.
- Updated email and web pages in documentation.
